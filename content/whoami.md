Husband, Software Engineer, Bench Press Enthusiast, OOP Wizard.

I enjoy building fun things and occasionally writing about what I learn along the way.

I got a masters and bachelors degree in Computer Science from Uppsala University.
Feel free to check my theses out:

- [Improving on C with Rust - An analysis of Rusts preventative abilities](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&c=2&af=%5B%5D&searchType=SIMPLE&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&query=kevin+alemi&language=sv&pid=diva2%3A1484691&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&sf=undergraduate&aqe=%5B%5D&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=916)
- [Input Validation and Input Sanitization for Web Applications](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&c=1&af=%5B%5D&searchType=SIMPLE&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&query=kevin+alemi&language=sv&pid=diva2%3A1610991&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&sf=undergraduate&aqe=%5B%5D&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=-9838)

In my spare time, you'll find me lifting weights, spending time with friends and family, or working on side projects.
I also enjoy reading about programming languages, distributed systems and just in general latest tech news, especially on HackerNews and Lobsters.

Otherwise I'm probably rewatching LOTR or Mr. Robot.
